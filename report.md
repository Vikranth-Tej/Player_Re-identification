# 🎥 Single Feed Player Re-Identification — Technical Report

---

## 🧠 Approach & Methodology

This project tackles the challenge of **re-identifying players** within a **single-camera sports video**—a problem typically solved using multi-view setups or player-specific appearance data. The goal was to build a **self-contained, lightweight system** that could:

1. Detect players frame-by-frame
2. Track and assign temporary IDs
3. Re-identify players who re-enter the scene using visual features

The pipeline is structured as follows:

- **YOLOv11** for player detection
- **CNN-based embeddings** for appearance feature extraction
- **SORT** (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) for temporal ID assignment
- **Cosine similarity** between embedding vectors for re-identification
- **OpenCV visualizer** to overlay IDs, boxes, confidence scores, and stats

## 🧪 Techniques Tried & Their Outcomes

| Component | Technique | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Detection | YOLOv11 via `ultralytics` | Good general accuracy, but jitter on occlusion |
| Feature Extraction | Pretrained ResNet50 | Worked for short durations; failed under rapid motion |
| Re-identification | Cosine Similarity + Centroid Matching | Decent in short spans, but ID drift in long sequences |
| Tracking | SORT | Lightweight and fast, but loses continuity on missed detections |
| Visualization | OpenCV annotations | Effective and readable; aided manual inspection |

## 🚧 Challenges Encountered

Despite building a complete pipeline, the system does **not consistently re-identify players** across time. The core issues faced:

- **Occlusions and exits**: Players going off-frame broke the ID continuity.
- **Visual similarity**: Same-colored jerseys made appearance features ineffective.
- **Short video duration**: Not enough data to establish long-term ID consistency.
- **ReID fragility**: Cosine similarity alone was not robust enough.

This version is **functional but far from production-grade** in terms of identification accuracy.

## ⏳ Incomplete Aspects & How I’d Improve With More Time

If given additional resources and time, I would:

- 🧠 **Train a domain-specific ReID network** using sports player datasets
- 🔁 Add a **ReID Memory Bank** to track historical features over longer windows
- 🦾 Introduce **pose or motion-based features** alongside appearance cues
- 📏 Tune thresholds dynamically for similarity matching and ID assignment
- ⏱️ Optimize I/O pipeline for reduced latency on larger/longer videos

## 📦 Reproducibility

This system is designed to be self-contained and easily reproducible:

- Clone repo or download `.ipynb` + `requirements.txt`
- Place `15sec_input_720p.mp4` in the working directory
- Run `python single_feed_reid.py` or notebook sequentially
- Output:  
  - `15sec_output_reidentified_720p.mp4` (video)  
  - `15sec_output_reidentified_720p_results.json` (stats)

> All dependencies are standard (`ultralytics`, `torch`, `opencv-python`, `scipy`, `scikit-learn`, `gdown`)

## 🧾 Evaluation Criteria (Reflection)

| Criteria | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Accuracy** | Partially successful; IDs drift during occlusion and re-entry |
| **Simplicity & Modularity** | Clean, readable code; each step modularly separated |
| **Documentation** | Well-documented setup, flow, and limitations |
| **Runtime Efficiency** | Runs in real time (25-30 FPS) on CPU; better with GPU |
| **Thoughtfulness** | Pipeline mimics production logic, but lacks deeper learning layers for ReID |

## 💭 Final Thoughts

While the current system doesn’t fully achieve reliable re-identification, it reflects a **real-world-inspired, constraint-aware attempt** to solve a hard computer vision problem under limited resources.

The outcome is a **proof-of-concept**: capable of detection, tracking, and partial re-ID — but requiring deeper model integration and domain tuning for consistent performance.

I look forward to refining this further and appreciate the opportunity to explore a complex, open-ended problem like this.
